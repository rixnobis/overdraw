# Boot overdraw.ps-exe headless and grab a frame.
#
# Two things this script refuses to get wrong, both learned the expensive way:
#
#  * A valid PNG is not evidence. The still endpoint serves an all-background
#    frame with the same HTTP status and the same `file` output as a rendered
#    one, so grading on "curl exited 0 and the file is a PNG" passes a run that
#    grabbed before the guest drew anything. The histogram is the discriminator:
#    a real frame has many colors, a too-early frame has one.
#  * Teardown walks the PID tree. `pkill -f pcsx-redux` self-matches the shell
#    running it and also kills every other worktree's emulator, including other
#    people's sessions.
#
# Usage: ./shoot.sh [out.png] [port] [seconds-before-grab]
